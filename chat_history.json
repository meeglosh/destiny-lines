People probably see you as steady and reliable when it comes to making choices.\r\n\r\n\u2764\ufe0f Heart Line\r\n\r\nYour heart line sits higher and looks straighter than deeply curved.

You might not be wildly expressive all the time, but when you commit, you commit deeply.\r\n\r\n\u270b Shape of the Hand\r\n\r\nYour hand looks rectangular with longer fingers \u2014 this is sometimes called an \u201cair hand.\u201d In palmistry, that\u2019s tied to curiosity, communication, and creativity. You probably like exploring ideas, connecting dots, and solving problems in inventive ways.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf1f Overall Reading\r\n\r\nYour palm suggests someone who\u2019s resilient, thoughtful, and steady in both practical and emotional life. You balance a curious, creative mind with a strong need for groundedness.

You want to create an AI-powered palm reading app called \"Destiny Lines\" using React Native and Expo 54.

This photo will then be sent to ChatGPT for analysis.\n*   **AI Palm Reading Results Display:** Create a screen to display the palm reading results received from ChatGPT. The results should be clearly formatted and easy to read, as in your example.\n*   **Native Sharing Functionality:** Integrate the device's native sharing capabilities so users can easily share their palm reading results with friends and family.\n*   **Ad Integration:** Integrate ad support into the app.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Base color: Light beige or off-white to give an earthy, mystical feel.\n    *   Primary text color: Dark brown or charcoal gray for readability.\n    *   Accent colors: Deep greens and golds to evoke nature and wisdom.\n    *   Highlight shades: Subtle gradients of the accent colors to draw attention to key information.\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern, clean font like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for the main text.\n    *   Consider a slightly more decorative font for headings, such as \"Playfair Display\" or \"Lora,\" to add a touch of elegance.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-30T21:46:19.224497"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the \"Destiny Lines\" AI-powered palm reading app. Let me start by examining the current project structure and then build the necessary components."}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "constants/Colors.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I need to install the necessary dependencies for the palm reading app. I'll need expo-image-picker for camera functionality and expo-sharing for sharing results."}, {"type": "dependency_management", "action": "install", "dependencies": ["expo-sharing", "@expo-google-fonts/playfair-display", "@expo-google-fonts/open-sans"], "status": "complete", "success": true, "stdout": "Progress: resolved 1, reused 0, downloaded 0, added 0\n\n   \u256d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n   \u2502                                          \u2502\n   \u2502   Update available! 10.16.0 \u2192 10.17.1.   \u2502\n   \u2502   Changelog: https://pnpm.io/v/10.17.1   \u2502\n   \u2502     To update, run: pnpm add -g pnpm     \u2502\n   \u2502                                          \u2502\n   \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n\n\u2009WARN\u2009 deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from@7.18.9: This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained.
